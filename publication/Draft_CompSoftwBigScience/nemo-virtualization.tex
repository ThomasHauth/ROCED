\begin{abstract}
Particle Physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) need a high
amount of computing resources for data processing, simulation, and analysis.
High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources provided by universities
can be useful supplements to the existing World-wide LHC Computing Grid resources
allocated by the collaboration. At the university of Frei\-burg, the
shared HPC cluster "NEMO" has been made available to ATLAS and CMS
users accessing NEMO from external collaboration-specific resources.
 To this effect, the full environment corresponding to a WLCG center
 is provided. The interplay between the NEMO and the external
 resources' schedulers is ensured through the ROCED service.
An OpenStack infrastructure is deployed at NEMO to orchestrate the
simultaneous usage for bare metal and virtualized jobs.
Through the setup, resources are provided to users in an automatized,
on-demand way. The performance of the virtualized environment has been
evaluated for particle physics jobs.

\section{Generation of the image}

The image for the virtual machine should be provided in an automatized
way allowing versioning and archiving of the environments captured in
the images. The approaches used in the
different groups are described in the following.

\section{Analysis of performance and usage}

The approach described so far has been implemented and put into
production in the research groups at University of Freiburg
(Physikalisches Institut) and Karlsruhe (... Institut).
The following chapter presents statistical results of the analysis of
the performance of the virtualized setup both in terms of job
performance as well as usage statistics.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}


A system for the dynamic, on-demand provisioning of virtual machines
to run jobs in a High-Energy Physics context on an external, not
dedicated resource as realized at the HPC
cluster ``NEMO'' at University of Freiburg has been described. 
Reasons for the need for an interface between the schedulers of the host system
and the external system from which requests are sent have been
explained. 
The performance and usage have been analyzed for two groups. 

This approach can be generalized to other platforms and possibly also
other forms of virtualized environments (containers).
