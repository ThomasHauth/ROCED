\begin{abstract}
Particle Physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) need a high
amount of computing resources for data processing, simulation, and analysis.
High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources provided by universities
can be useful supplements to the existing WLCG computing resources
allocated by the collaboration. At the university of Freiburg, the
shared HPC cluster "NEMO" has been made available to ATLAS and CMS
users accessing NEMO from external collaboration-specific resources.
 To this effect, the full environment corresponding to a WLCG center
 is provided. The interplay between the NEMO and the external
 resources' schedulers is ensured through the ROCED service.
An OpenStack infrastructure is deployed at NEMO to orchestrate the
parallel usage for bare metal and virtualized jobs.
Through the setup, resources are provided to users in an automatized,
on-demand way. The performance of the virtualized environment has been
evaluated for particle physics jobs.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

This paper presents the concepts and implementation of providing a HPC
resource to ATLAS and CMS users accessing external clusters connected
to the World-wide computing grid (WLCG) with the purpose of running
data production as well as data analysis on the HPC host system.
For this purpose, the HPC cluster NEMO at the University of Freiburg
is deploying an OpenStack instance to handle the virtual machines.
The schedulers on the NEMO and the external resources are connected
through the ROCED service\cite{ROCED}.


%virtualizing the ATLAS software environment to run both data analysis and production on the HPC host system which is connected to the existing Tier-3 infrastructure. Main challenges include the integration into the NEMO and Tier-3 schedulers in a dynamic, on-demand way, the scalability of the OpenStack infrastructure, as well as the automatic generation of a fully functional virtual machine image providing access to the local user environment, the dCache storage element and the parallel file system. The performance in the virtualized environment is evaluated for typical High-Energy Physics applications.
