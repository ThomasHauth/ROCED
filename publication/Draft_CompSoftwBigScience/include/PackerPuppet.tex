One approach to generating the image is the open-source tool
\texttt{packer}~\cite{packer}, interfaced to \texttt{puppet}~\cite{puppet}.
\texttt{Packer} allows to configure an image based on an \texttt{.iso} file using a kickstart~\cite{kickstart} file and flexible script-based configuration. 
It also provides an interface to \texttt{puppet} making it a convenient tool if an existing \texttt{puppet} role is to be used for the images. If the roles are defined according to the hostname of the machine as is conventional in \texttt{puppet} with \texttt{hieradata}, the hostname needs to be set in the scripts supplied to \texttt{packer}. Propagation of certificates require an initial manual start of a machine with the same hostname to allow handshake signing of the certificate from the \texttt{puppet} server.

Apart from these initial adjustments, \texttt{packer}'s interface to \texttt{puppet} allows a fully automated image generation with up-to-date configuration.
